"# KidzApp" 
KidzApp is implemented in MEAN stack. This is for the pre primary kids which going to start with numbers, alphabets etc. I have implemented only the Number Section. My project folder has 2 subfolders Server and KidzApp which is for the server side and client side. I used MongoDB Compass for the database section.
 In mongodb there is KidzDb database and in it 2 collections are there for the user credentials and for the website. One should register their name and details before continue to login . 
Users can see the puzzles which is the number section.
Admin has the CRUD operations . Credentials for the Admin to login to the admin page is 
username: admin
password: 12345
In the login page Admin Login button redirects to the Admin login page .
